# üåø Exit Soul Protocol: A Burnout Recovery System for Tech Workers

**TL;DR: I made a printable "Soul Peace Agreement" for people who need to formalize their inner decision to leave a toxic work environment, giving themselves permission for a 30-day evaluation period. It's open source, free, and multilingual.**

Hey everyone,

After experiencing severe burnout twice in my career, I created something I wish I'd had years ago ‚Äì the **Exit Soul Protocol**, a formal document that helps you reclaim your mental health when you're stuck in a toxic job but feeling guilty about leaving.

## What is it?

It's a beautifully formatted document you can print, sign, and use as a personal commitment to:

* Enter a 30-day evaluation period  
* Withdraw emotional investment while remaining professionally responsible  
* Create space for recovery and planning  
* Make a final decision without guilt or external pressure  

## Why I Made This

Many of us in tech stay in harmful environments far too long. We feel responsible for systems, teams, or outcomes that are ultimately destroying us.

The Exit Soul Protocol is my attempt to add **ritual and formality** to your inner decision, giving you permission to prioritize yourself first.

## What's Included:

* Professional LaTeX template for the "Soul Peace Agreement"  
* PDFs ready to print in multiple languages (English, Finnish, with more coming)  
* Guided framework for your 30-day evaluation  
* No judgement on your final decision ‚Äì stay with boundaries, redesign your career, or exit completely  

## How to Get It:

Everything is available at: [https://github.com/sorsat/exit-soul-protocol](https://github.com/sorsat/exit-soul-protocol)

If you find it helpful, you can donate, but it's completely free under CC0 license.

Be well, and remember to prioritize your mental health over any job.
